## a simple python script that approximates pi with the darts method

### the darts method:
this method first proves that if one inscribes a circle in a square, then pi = 4 times the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square.
one could imagine this as a dart board, and the number of times a dart lands in the circle vs the square is the ratio of areas. this can then be used to approximate pi.

### the code:
this code lets the user input a number (bigger number means more precision) and then it throws N darts. it then saves the x and y coordinates of these darts and graphs them, to visualize the scatter of the darts on the board. the graph then has a very distinct shape that resembles an inscribed circle.
